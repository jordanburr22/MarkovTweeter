The founders also specified a process by which the Constitution may be amended and since its ratification the Constitution has been amended 27 times. In order to prevent arbitrary changes the process for making amendments is quite onerous. An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress or if two-thirds of the states request one by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. In modern times amendments have traditionally specified a timeframe in which this must be accomplished usually a period of several years. Additionally the Constitution specifies that no amendment can deny a state equal representation in the Senate without that stateâ€™s consent.
